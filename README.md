# KMSpico – what is it and how does Windows and Office activation work

## What is KMSpico?
KMSpico is a program for activating Windows and Microsoft Office without entering a license key. It uses KMS (Key Management Service) technology, which is used by corporations for mass activation of software. KMSPico.at creates a local KMS server on your PC, allowing the system to consider it officially activated.

## How KMS activation works
KMS technology was developed by Microsoft for large organizations. It allows you to automatically activate products without an Internet connection by contacting the company's server. KMSpico emulates such a server locally, bypassing the need to purchase keys.

## How to download KMSpico
The program cannot be downloaded from the official Microsoft website, as it violates the licensing policy. However, there are many resources on the Internet offering to download it. Be careful: malicious files are often distributed under the guise of KMSpico. Use only trusted sources.

## How to use KMSpico
1. Run the program as an administrator.
2. Press the activation button.
3. Wait for the process to complete.
4. Restart the computer and the system will be activated.

## Why activation keys are no longer needed
After using KMSpico, Windows and Office automatically extend activation every time they start. This eliminates the need to search for new keys and enter them manually.

## Legality and risks of use
The use of KMSpico is contrary to the Microsoft license agreement. In addition, many versions of the program contain viruses and malicious code. We do not recommend using it for its intended purpose – the material is provided solely for informational purposes.
